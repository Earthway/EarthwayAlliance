      <p>Founder Earthway Alliance Company</p>
      <p>Profile Summary<p>
With extensive experience in climate change mitigation, adaptation and environmental restoration, Amos has led high-impact initiatives across Kenya. 
His expertise encompasses afforestation, reforestation, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), and climate-smart agriculture. 
He has successfully coordinated large-scale tree-growing programs, including the planting of over 500,000 trees and the restoration of thousands of hectares of degraded land.
Amos has trained over 1,700 households in FMNR and agroforestry practices, facilitated the establishment of environmental clubs in schools, and built the capacity of community groups in sustainable land management. 
His work has empowered communities in counties such as Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nakuru to adopt climate-resilient practices enhancing livelihoods, increasing carbon sequestration, and supporting biodiversity conservation.</p>
